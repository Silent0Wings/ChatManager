# ClientDataManager

## Overview
Project Report .[here](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/ClientDataManager/blob/f6a85b6ad62ed80b9f4e67fc1c055a2dd66efdc4/Github.pdf).

**ClientDataManager** is a Java-based application designed to manage client profiles efficiently. The project includes components for creating, storing, and retrieving client information, parsing strings for specific data extraction, and defining standardized interfaces for client operations.

## Features
- **Client Profile Management**: Create, update, and manage detailed client profiles.
- **String Parsing**: Extract and manipulate client-related data from strings.
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Ensure consistency in client operations through the implementation of interfaces.

## Project Structure

- **Client_Profile.java**: Handles the management of client profiles, including storing and retrieving personal information.
- **String_Parse.java**: Provides methods for parsing strings, validating, and extracting specific information.
- **Client.java**: Represents a client entity with attributes and methods for interacting with client data.
- **Client_Interface.java**: Defines the required methods for any client-related class, ensuring standardized operations.

## How to Use
1. **Client Profile Management**: Use the `Client_Profile` class to manage client information. You can create, update, and retrieve client profiles through this class.
2. **String Parsing**: Utilize the `String_Parse` class to handle any string-related operations, such as validation or data extraction from strings.
3. **Client Class**: Implement client-specific behaviors and attributes through the `Client` class, which interacts with other components for data management.
4. **Client Interface**: Ensure any new client-related class implements the `Client_Interface` to maintain consistency in the application's client operations.

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
